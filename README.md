# Orb

Fully networked assymetric shooter made in unity. The game takes place on the inside of a sphere which you can fully traverse and if the opportunity presents itself shoot enemies directly above your head. The environment is also fully destructible, with the abilitiy to dig into caves to mine money or find portals to special weapons. The two classes have different abilities, the gunners have multiple weapons and grenades some of which need to be purchased and the wizards have a shield, a shock attack and can levitate voxels from the destructible ground and shoot it at enemies.

I know what you're thinking and yes there was a lot of scope creep

This was made as a 3rd year final project for our CS/game dev course. Find some previews of the game in [UCT's project archive](https://projects.cs.uct.ac.za/gamesproj/cgi-bin/view/2018/abramowitz_acton_toledo.zip/OrbWebsite/)
